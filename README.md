# Coffee-Sales-Analysis-with-Excel
## Project Overview
This project was an exciting deep dive into coffee sales data using Microsoft Excel. I wanted to understand who was buying, what they were buying, and where sales were booming. The dataset came in three separate tables—Orders, Customers, and Products—so my first challenge was merging everything into a single, more insightful dataset.

To do this, I used XLOOKUP to pull in customer details (like country and loyalty card status) and product attributes (coffee type, roast type, size, and price) into the Orders table. This gave me a complete view of each transaction, making analysis much smoother.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Merged Data for Better Insights: Using XLOOKUP, I pulled in all the missing details, transforming the Orders table into a powerhouse of information.
- Checked for Duplicates: No room for messy data; I made sure every entry was unique.
- Converted to an Excel Table: I did this so my Pivot Tables would automatically update whenever I refreshed the dataset. No need to redo everything manually.

## Dashboard Development
This was my favorite part, building an interactive dashboard that made the data come to life. I wanted to create something that didn’t just look good but actually helped tell the story behind the sales.

### Pivot Tables for Key Metrics:
- Tracked total sales over time
- Identified the best-selling coffee types
- Ranked sales by country
- Highlighted the top 5 customers

### Slicers & Timelines for Interactivity:
- Slicers let me filter by Size, Loyalty Card status, and Roast Type with just a click.
- A Timeline made it easy to view sales trends across months and years.
