# Coffee-Sales-Analysis-with-Excel
## Project Overview
This project was an exciting deep dive into coffee sales data using Microsoft Excel. I wanted to understand who was buying, what they were buying, and where sales were booming. The dataset came in three separate tables- Orders, Customers, and Products. So my first challenge was merging everything into a single, more insightful dataset.

To do this, I used XLOOKUP to pull in customer details (like country and loyalty card status) and product attributes (coffee type, roast type, size, and price) into the Orders table. This gave me a complete view of each transaction, making analysis much smoother.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Merged Data for Better Insights: Using XLOOKUP, I pulled in all the missing details, transforming the Orders table into a powerhouse of information.
- Checked for Duplicates: No room for messy data; I made sure every entry was unique.
- Converted to an Excel Table: I did this so my Pivot Tables would automatically update whenever I refreshed the dataset. No need to redo everything manually.

## Dashboard Development
This was my favorite part, building an interactive dashboard that made the data come to life. I wanted to create something that didn’t just look good but actually helped tell the story behind the sales.

### Pivot Tables for Key Metrics:
- Tracked total sales over time
- Identified the best-selling coffee types
- Ranked sales by country
- Highlighted the top 5 customers

### Slicers & Timelines for Interactivity:
- Slicers let me filter by Size, Loyalty Card status, and Roast Type with just a click.
- A Timeline made it easy to view sales trends across months and years.

### A Clean & Engaging Visual Design:
- I went for an earthy coffee-themed color palette (green and orange) to keep things aesthetic and readable.
- The layout was designed to flow naturally, guiding the viewer from overall trends to specific insights.

## Key Insights I Discovered
 The U.S. completely dominated sales. With $35,639 in revenue, it left other countries far behind (Ireland at $6,697 and the UK at $2,799). If I were running this business, I’d double down on marketing in the U.S. since it’s clearly the biggest source of revenue.

- Loyalty Card members spent more. Customers with a loyalty card were making bigger purchases than non-members. This tells me that getting more people to sign up for the loyalty program could directly boost revenue.

- Aramistica & Exotica were the crowd favorites. These coffee types had the highest sales, proving that customers had strong preferences. I’d make sure to always have them in stock and featured in promotions.

- Sales had clear seasonal peaks. March, June, and December saw big spikes. This insight is gold because it means targeted promotions during these months could bring in even more sales.

- A few top customers were driving a huge chunk of sales. The top 5 customers alone were responsible for a significant portion of revenue. This made me think: why not nurture these high-spending customers with personalized offers?

## What I’d Do Next
- Leverage the U.S. market: Sales are already strong here, so focusing more on ads, partnerships, or promotions in the U.S. would be a smart move.

- Push the loyalty card program: If bigger orders come from loyalty members, I’d find creative ways to incentivize sign-ups, maybe through discounts or referral bonuses.

- Keep Aramistica & Exotica in the spotlight: These are the clear winners, so they should always be well-stocked and featured in marketing campaigns.

- Prepare for seasonal sales surges: Since March, June, and December saw spikes, running exclusive discounts or bundle deals during these months could maximize revenue.

- Engage high-value customers personally: A simple thank-you email or special discount for top buyers could keep them coming back.

## Final Thoughts
This project was an eye-opener for me. The magic of XLOOKUP and Pivot Table is one of the reasons why I enjoy working with Excel. Every formula, every pivot table, and every chart I built told a story, not just about sales but also about customer behavior, business strategy, and growth opportunities.

This wasn’t just a dashboard; it was a data-driven decision-making tool. If I were running this coffee business, I’d already have a solid plan for boosting sales based on these insights.

And that’s the power of data analysis, it turns numbers into strategy.
